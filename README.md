### Built with

-  HTML5
-  CSS with Flexbox
-  Javascript


## My process

Using HTML to create the sections of the web page, I created the user selection part first, and then I began to apply the style sheets to the first part of the page, then I began to layout the thank you part of the page with HTML and CSS and using a display none to hide the thank you part, with javascript I went through all the buttons on the page and then show it in the DOM using the events.
